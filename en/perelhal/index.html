<strong>Perelhal</strong>, patron saint San Palo, was a vicariate of the presentation of the Chapter of Braga.
<br />
Perelhal, says Father António Gomes Pereira, in his book "Folk Traditions", which comes from Latin piri-cl-ale (ale-piricul), the place of small pears; or directly from Portuguese: pear, paral, perêlha, Perelhal.<br />
This parish is in the 1220 Inquests with designation = De Sancto Pelagio Pereira anlal = Land of Neiva.
<br />
Them are said: «quod habet ibi dominus Rex 21 casalia et terciam et senarias, et dant inde terciam fructus in villa, et in monte quartam».
<br />
«Et si homo voluerit recedere de villa dabit 1 morabitinum, 2 solidos, et sic ibi liber. Et si aliquis venerit habitare in villam ipsam et voluerit habitare in villam ipsam et voluerit recedere infra annum, non dabit nisi 2 solidos. Quod Rex est inde patronus. Quod ista ecclesia habet unam senariam».
<br />
In 1258 Inquiries, Appeals 1, it says: In Judicato de Nevia, Item, in parrochia Sancti Pelagii de Perylar «que dominus Rex est patronus et senor desta ecclesia, et ha el Rey in est couto 21 casal et tercia»... «et devem et am de levar os lavradores destes casaes o pam del a agua de Nevya ataes Regauffi u lis mandar o Mayordomo. E ha y el Rey 5 pezas de Regaengo in Perilar, que dá o Mayordomo por sua offreciom a quem li mais da. E ha y el Rey 3 moynos».
<br />
... «Et ha y el Rey 7 casas». «E se o omem se quiser sair do casal ha a dar al Rey um maravedi 2 soldos e ir-se in paz.
<br />
Item, dixerunt que Cabanelas est d'el Rey as duas partes, et a tertia derdadores del Rey. Et, dixerunt que esses erdadores tragem mais ca seu dereito de Cabanelas.<br />
Item, os omees de Pereliar forum abrir una bouza por sua contra Jumezes e semearom y suas favas, et veo Roy Fernandiz de jumeces com seus omees de noite et taliou ende as favas: et ora tem Fernando de Lago essa bouza, e non na am os de Pereliar».<br />
The parish of St. Paio Perelhal was all reguenga, she says A. Herculano, in the history of Portugal, volume 3, note 1.ª.<br />
Perelhal was included with many other land grant in King John I made ​​the bastard son Afonso to marry Brites Pereira d'Alvim, daughter of the great constable Dom Nuno Alvares Pereira, on November 8, 1401.<br />

The parish church of this parish was formerly in Passal, being changed to where it is built in the eighteenth century and this season the grand temple that you see.<br />
This church is in the center of a churchyard, surrounded by the wall, with a door flanked by six pyramids, for which you descend seven stone steps.<br />
In broad facade of the temple opens a well worked portico, whose lintel is the inscription there. 'The 1764', over a small rosette, which gives light to the chorus, and on the architrave, which crosses the facade, niche with the image in stone, a third of the natural, the Patron Saint Paio. <br />

In this display, next to the tower and over the cornoja church, one sees the following inscription: "The Brotherhood of SS. SACRAMENTO 1916 ". <br /> 
Behind the tower were built the sacristy which still retain their curious ceilings maceira with flowers. <br />

At Mount St. Michael, with the limits of this parish of Vila Cova, there was a small chapel of the invocation of São Miguel. 
Tradition tells us that the image of their patron, no one knows why reason, repeatedly disappeared from his home and went to hide in a thicket, which then was the site where now stands the chapel of relief. The people, believing that the saint wanted to come and live there and leave the wilderness of mount that demolished chapel and arroteando the marsh, built on the site where the image was found a small temple. <br /> 
Existed the templozinho St. Michael this site a long time, until there are close to eighty years, solving building next to it the Chapel of Our Lady of relief, was demolished, serving its stone to build this. <Br /> 
The image of St. Michael then went on to be venerated in the new chapel, next to Our Lady of the relief. <br />
